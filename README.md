# Creating Vector Data Using GIS

This task aims to create spatial vector data by digitizing features from a georeferenced Google Maps image using ArcMap. The process introduces georeferencing, vector digitization, and attribute management in a GIS environment.

---

## Objective

- To understand the process of georeferencing raster images
- To create vector data (points, lines, or polygons) through on-screen digitization
- To store and manage spatial attributes in a GIS attribute table

---

## Workflow

### 1. Study Area Identification
- Identify the target **kabupaten** using Google Maps.
- Zoom into a specific area within the study region.

### Google Maps Screenshot

### 2. Screenshot and Control Points
- Capture a screenshot of the selected Google Maps area.
- Select **four control points** that can be clearly identified and referenced.

### 3. Georeferencing
- Import the screenshot into **ArcMap**.
- Perform georeferencing using the four selected control points to align the image with the map coordinate system.

### 4. Vector Digitization
- Create vector features from the georeferenced image, such as:
  - Building polygons
  - Road lines
  - Landmark points
- Digitization is performed manually in ArcMap.

### 5. Attribute Creation
- Store relevant information for each vector feature in the **attribute table**, such as name, type, or description.

## Output Requirements

Include the following screenshots in the report:

1. **Vector Data Map**
   - Display the digitized vector features
   - Show attribute labels on the map

2. **Attribute Table**
   - Display the attribute table containing vector data information

---

## Tools Used

- Google Maps (source imagery)
- ArcMap (georeferencing, digitization, and attribute management)

The final output consists of georeferenced raster imagery, digitized vector layers, and properly populated attribute tables, demonstrating fundamental GIS data creation techniques.
